# Predict-Movie-ratings-using-Network-Analysis-in-Python

### Purpose:
  To prove out that networkx metrics and algorithms can add value to machine learning models.
  
### How:
  Can relationships between directors and actors add value in predicting IMDB scores. 
  
### Why:
  There is an oppurtunity in automating projects using machine learning even when attribute data may not be available. Solely   automating tasks based on relationships is possible.
